# Detection-of-dog-breed

This project has been made as a part of Udemy course "Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp 2022" from ZTM Academy.
All nesessary data could be found there: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data
The custom data, that I used in the the very end of the notebook to check how model works on custom images could be found in a folder "dog-photos".
